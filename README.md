# Librarymanagement

A website for managing your library with a fantasy theme that can display different books and let you sort them by author, title, description, You can also choose to view 5, 10, or 15 books per page using the pagination option. As an administrator, you can also add categories and book details; but, as a user, you can only read them. (Work is ongoing for both the admin and user login.)
